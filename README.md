# Using-Data-Science-to-Evaluate-and-Visualize-Paging


## 1. First In First Out (FIFO) – 

This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal. 

## 2. Optimal Page replacement – 
In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.

## 3. Least Recently Used – 
In this algorithm page will be replaced which is least recently used.
